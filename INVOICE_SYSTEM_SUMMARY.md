# CTC Invoice System - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Successfully Implemented and Verified

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

A complete invoice management system integrated into the existing CTC Smart-Hands WordPress plugin.

### Core Features Implemented:

1. **Database Schema** - `wp_ctc_invoices` table with 18 columns:
   - Invoice numbering (INV-YYYYMMDD-XXXX format)
   - Booking relationship (booking_id)
   - Financial fields (subtotal, tax_rate, tax_amount, total_amount)
   - Line items (JSON storage)
   - Payment tracking (paid_date, payment_method, payment_reference)
   - Status management (draft, sent, paid, overdue, cancelled)
   - Metadata (notes, pdf_url, sent_at, created_by, updated_at)

2. **REST API Endpoints** (6 endpoints with HMAC authentication):
   - `POST /wp-json/ctc/v1/invoices` - Create invoice
   - `GET /wp-json/ctc/v1/invoices` - List invoices (paginated, filterable)
   - `GET /wp-json/ctc/v1/invoices/{id}` - Get invoice details
   - `PATCH /wp-json/ctc/v1/invoices/{id}` - Update invoice (mark as paid)
   - `DELETE /wp-json/ctc/v1/invoices/{id}` - Delete invoice
   - `GET /wp-json/ctc/v1/bookings/{id}/invoice` - Get invoice for booking

3. **Auto-Invoice Generation**:
   - Automatically creates invoices when booking status changes to "completed"
   - Calculates service fees based on work type
   - Adds regional travel costs
   - Applies 10% GST (Australian tax)
   - Sets due date (default 7 days)

4. **Pricing Configuration**:
   - **Service Rates:**
     - Break/Fix: $150.00
     - Rollout: $200.00
     - POS Support: $175.00
     - Site Audit: $180.00
     - Parts Logistics: $120.00

   - **Travel Rates by Region:**
     - Bendigo: $80.00
     - Ballarat: $100.00
     - Shepparton: $120.00
     - Wodonga: $150.00
     - Latrobe: $140.00
     - Melbourne: $0.00 (no travel charge)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Created:
- `class-invoice.php` (14KB) - Complete invoice management class with CRUD operations

### Files Modified:
- `ctc-smart-hands.php` - Added Invoice class loading and initialization
- `class-database.php` - Added invoice table creation, removed FOREIGN KEY constraints
- `class-rest-api.php` - Added 6 invoice REST API endpoints (lines 182-306, 705-916)

### Key Technical Decisions:

1. **No Separate Plugin** - Integrated into existing CTC Smart-Hands plugin
2. **No FOREIGN KEY Constraints** - dbDelta() doesn't support them (causes SQL errors)
3. **Application-Level Integrity** - Enforce referential integrity in code, not database
4. **JSON Storage** - Line items stored as JSON for flexibility
5. **HMAC Authentication** - All modifying endpoints require secure authentication

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Plugin Activation Not Loading Invoice Class
**Problem:** Invoice class wasn't loaded during activation, so `Invoice::create_table()` failed.

**Solution:** Modified `activate()` in `ctc-smart-hands.php` to call `$this->load_dependencies()` before `Database::create_tables()`.

**Files Changed:**
- `ctc-smart-hands.php` (line 122)

### Issue #2: SQL Errors During Table Creation
**Problem:** WordPress `dbDelta()` doesn't support FOREIGN KEY constraints. When included, dbDelta tried to parse CONSTRAINT lines as column definitions, causing SQL syntax errors:
```
WordPress database error You have an error in your SQL syntax;
check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for
the right syntax to use near 'CONSTRAINT fk_invoice_booking
FOREIGN KEY (booking_id)'
```

**Solution:** Removed all FOREIGN KEY constraints from table definitions. Application code enforces referential integrity instead.

**Files Changed:**
- `class-invoice.php` (lines 46-72) - Removed lines 72-74
- `class-database.php` (lines 79-90) - Removed lines 90-93

**Documentation Updated:**
- Added critical warning in `CLAUDE.md` about dbDelta limitations

### Verification Process:
1. ✅ Used Chrome DevTools MCP to access WordPress admin
2. ✅ Manually deactivated and reactivated plugin
3. ✅ Created verification PHP page to check database tables
4. ✅ Confirmed all 3 tables exist with correct structure
5. ✅ Verified no SQL errors in WordPress debug.log
6. ✅ Cleaned up all test files after verification

## 📋 Next Steps (Pending)

1. **Build Next.js admin invoice list page** (`/admin/invoices`)
   - Display all invoices in a data table
   - Filter by status, date range, booking
   - Sort by columns
   - Pagination

2. **Add "Generate Invoice" button to booking modal**
   - Button appears when booking status = "completed"
   - Triggers invoice creation via API
   - Shows success/error feedback

3. **Create invoice preview/edit modal**
   - View invoice details
   - Edit line items
   - Mark as paid
   - Download PDF (future)

4. **Add PDF generation**
   - Professional invoice template
   - Company branding
   - Line item breakdown
   - Payment instructions

5. **Integrate email sending for invoices**
   - Auto-send via Resend API
   - Email templates
   - Tracking (sent_at timestamp)

## 📊 System Status

**WordPress Backend:**
- ✅ Database tables created
- ✅ REST API endpoints active
- ✅ HMAC authentication working
- ✅ Auto-invoice generation configured

**Next.js Frontend:**
- ⏳ Admin invoice page (not started)
- ⏳ Invoice generation UI (not started)
- ⏳ Invoice preview modal (not started)

**Integration:**
- ✅ Plugin fully integrated
- ✅ No conflicts with existing bookings system
- ✅ Ready for frontend development

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- All invoice endpoints require HMAC authentication
- Booking ID validation prevents orphaned invoices
- Application-level referential integrity enforced in code
- Input validation with WordPress sanitization functions
- SQL injection protection via prepared statements ($wpdb)

---

## 📚 Documentation Updated

- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Added critical dbDelta limitation warning
- ✅ `INVOICE_ACTIVATION_GUIDE.md` - Updated with verification status
- ✅ Test files deleted after verification

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify with Chrome MCP** - Don't trust code changes alone, visually confirm results
2. **dbDelta has limitations** - No FOREIGN KEY support, use application-level integrity
3. **Clean up test files** - Delete temporary verification scripts after use
4. **Update documentation immediately** - Document issues and solutions in CLAUDE.md
5. **Load dependencies early** - Plugin activation hooks need classes loaded first

**Ready for frontend development!** 🚀
