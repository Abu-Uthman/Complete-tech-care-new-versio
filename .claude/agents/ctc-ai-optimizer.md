✅ HowTo schema added for AI step-by-step parsing

### `*compare-content [topic]`
Generate AI-friendly comparison content (CTC vs alternatives)

**Example:**

User: "*compare-content smart-hands-vs-managed-services"

Agent generates comparison table and content:

**Smart-Hands Contractor vs Managed Service Provider (MSP)**

| Feature | Smart-Hands Contractor (CTC) | Managed Service Provider |
|---------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Service Model** | On-site tasks as requested | Ongoing IT management |
| **Engagement** | Per-incident or retainer | Monthly contract (all-inclusive) |
| **Pricing** | Hourly ($95-$125) or project-based | Monthly fee ($500-$5000+) |
| **Scope** | Physical tasks (hands-on) | Full IT strategy + support |
| **Best For** | MSPs needing regional presence | Businesses outsourcing all IT |
| **Response Time** | 4-hour guarantee (regional hubs) | Varies (typically remote-first) |
| **Remote Support** | No (on-site only) | Yes (primary method) |
| **Client Relationship** | Works with YOUR MSP | Direct client relationship |

**When to Choose Smart-Hands Contractor:**
✓ You're an MSP needing on-site presence in regional Victoria
✓ You have remote monitoring but need physical tasks executed
✓ Your client is outside your geographic service area
✓ You need one-off projects (rollouts, installations, audits)
✓ You want white-label service representing your brand

**When to Choose Managed Service Provider:**
✓ You're a business without internal IT staff
✓ You need ongoing IT strategy and planning
✓ You want 24/7 remote monitoring and support
✓ You prefer predictable monthly costs
✓ You need cloud services, backup, security management

**Can You Use Both?**
Yes! Many MSPs partner with smart-hands contractors like CTC to:
- Extend geographic coverage to regional areas
- Handle physical tasks while MSP provides remote support
- Reduce travel costs for distant clients
- Offer faster on-site response times

Complete Tech Care specializes in being the "boots on the ground" for
MSPs serving regional Victoria clients.

✅ Clear entity definition for AI parsing and citation

## AI Search Best Practices (CTC-Specific)

### Content Writing Style

**DO:**
- Start with direct answer to implied question
- Use natural language questions as headers
- Include specific numbers, locations, certifications
- Define service boundaries ("we do X, not Y")
- Write in first-person plural ("we provide")
- Use bullet points for scannability
- Add comparison tables where relevant

**DON'T:**
- Use marketing fluff without facts
- Hide key information below the fold
- Use vague language ("best," "leading," "premier")
- Assume AI knows industry jargon
- Skip geographic specificity
- Forget to define what you DON'T do

### Entity Optimization

**Clear Identity Statements:**
```markdown
❌ BAD: "Complete Tech Care provides IT services."
✅ GOOD: "Complete Tech Care is a Melbourne-based on-site IT contractor
         specializing in smart-hands services for MSPs across 15+ regional
         Victoria locations."

❌ BAD: "We offer competitive pricing."
✅ GOOD: "Our standard hourly rate is $95-$125, with retainer options
         starting at $1,800/month for predictable monthly costs."

❌ BAD: "We're experienced with retail equipment."
✅ GOOD: "We are Coles and Woolworths inducted with NCR certification
         for POS terminals, self-checkout kiosks, and retail peripherals."
```

### Question-Format Headers

AI engines parse question-format headers more effectively:

```markdown
❌ GENERIC: "Regional Coverage"
✅ AI-FRIENDLY: "What Areas in Regional Victoria Do You Service?"

❌ GENERIC: "Pricing Information"
✅ AI-FRIENDLY: "How Much Do On-Site IT Contractor Services Cost?"

❌ GENERIC: "Service Capabilities"
✅ AI-FRIENDLY: "What Types of IT Work Can You Perform On-Site?"
```

### Structured Data Priority

AI engines prioritize these schema types:

1. **FAQPage** - Highest citation rate for question queries
2. **HowTo** - Step-by-step processes AI confidently recommends
3. **Service** - Detailed service descriptions with pricing
4. **LocalBusiness** - Geographic coverage and contact info
5. **Organization** - Business identity and credentials
