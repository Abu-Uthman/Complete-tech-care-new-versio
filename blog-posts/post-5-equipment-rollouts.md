> **TL;DR**
> - Regional rollouts live or die on logistics: document every site, stage parts locally, and book contractors in geographic clusters.
> - Run a pilot, capture lessons learned, then execute in waves—don’t let pressure skip the feedback loop.
> - Hypercare (2–4 weeks of elevated support) is where reputations are made; bake it into the project plan and budget.

Large-scale hardware refreshes are stressful enough in one location. Stretch that footprint across Bendigo, Ballarat, Shepparton, Wodonga, and the Latrobe Valley and the complexity multiplies. Deloitte’s *Technology Infrastructure Outlook 2024* found that 57% of rollout delays in Australia stem from poor site readiness or logistics—not technical capability. Follow the playbook below to stay in the winning 43%.

## Four Common Multi-Site Scenarios

| Scenario | Sites | Primary Risk | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Retail POS refresh | 15–50 stores | Trading-hour constraints | Requires SCO/POS vendor-certified technicians |
| Network upgrade | Offices/DCs | Misconfigured VLANs, downtime | Often weekend windows, remote validation essential |
| Server deployment | Regional offices | Freight + power/cooling | Pre-stage rack space, plan overnight cutovers |
| Workstation refresh | 10–100 seats/site | Productivity disruption | Profile migration + peripheral compatibility |

## Phase 1 – Pre-Rollout Planning

### Site Intelligence Pack

Collect the following for every location (store, branch, depot):

- **Access logistics:** exact address, dock instructions, parking, lift weight limits, after-hours codes.
- **Business constraints:** trading hours, blackout dates (stocktakes, audits), staff availability for testing.
- **Technical baseline:** asset inventory, network topology, IP schema, power availability, rack diagrams, existing issues.
- **Contacts:** store/branch lead, onsite IT (if any), security, escalation ladder.

> **Tip:** Store all packs in a shared project workspace (Confluence/SharePoint) with version control and change logs.

### Logistics Blueprint

- Decide on shipping method: **central warehouse**, **direct-to-site**, or **regional staging** (often optimal—e.g., Bendigo for northern sites, Traralgon for Latrobe hub).
- Catalogue consumables: cabling, labels, cable management, mounting hardware, PPE.
- Confirm tooling: torque drivers, cable testers, laptops with imaging software, ESD equipment.

### Change & Communications Timeline

| Timeline | Communication | Audience |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T-4 weeks | Project announcement, objectives, impact summary | All site leaders |
| T-2 weeks | Site-specific schedule, prep checklist | Site leads, facility managers |
| T-1 week | Final confirmation, access verification, go/no-go | Project sponsors, site contacts |
| Daily during rollout | Deployment progress, issues log | PMO, stakeholders |
| Post go-live | Completion summary, training resources | End users, support teams |

## Phase 2 – Execution Framework

### Deployment Strategies compared

| Strategy | Use When | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Parallel | Low complexity, ample resources | Fastest completion, cost-efficient | Issues replicate, heavy coordination |
| Sequential | High complexity, low risk tolerance | Learn every time, easier governance | Long timeline, higher travel cost |
| Pilot → Waves | Balanced risk/timeline | Validate process, scale confidently | Adds extra phase |
| Regional clusters | Sites grouped geographically | Minimal travel, local knowledge | Later regions wait longer |

Most organisations pick **Pilot (2 sites) → Regional Waves**: validate scripts, then hit one region per week.

### Day-of Deployment Checklist

**Pre-departure**

- [ ] Equipment and spares matched to BOM, powered on for burn-in.
- [ ] Work orders printed/digitally cached, with rollback steps highlighted.
- [ ] Photos of current rack/desk setup captured for reassembly reference.
- [ ] Site contact reconfirmed (call/SMS) with ETA.

**On arrival**

- [ ] Sign in, review scope with site lead, confirm outage window.
- [ ] Capture “before” photos.
- [ ] Verify power, rack, and network availability matches plan.

**During work**

- [ ] Follow runbook line-by-line; log deviations immediately.
- [ ] Label cables and hardware as you go.
- [ ] Provide mid-point update with photos to project channel.

**Before departure**

- [ ] Run full test plan (connectivity, application, user validation).
- [ ] Secure sign-off from authorised contact.
- [ ] Capture “after” photos and upload while onsite.
- [ ] Remove waste, return environment to operational state.

### Testing Pyramid

1. **Physical** – Power, cabling, cooling, rack integrity.  
2. **Network** – IP assignments, VLANs, gateway/internet access, WAN failover.  
3. **Application** – POS transactions, ERP, print services, VoIP, backups.  
4. **User acceptance** – Local champion signs off tasks, performance, peripherals.  

Document results in the ticket, not a separate spreadsheet—keep the audit trail in one system.

### Escalation Matrix

| Level | Trigger | Target Response | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1 – Field tech | Issue unresolved in 30 mins | Immediate | Reference knowledge base, call remote support |
| L2 – Remote engineer | Complex config error | 60 mins | Remote in, compare to gold build, advise on next steps |
| L3 – Project manager | Risk to schedule/budget | 2 hours | Decision on pause/continue, comms to client |
| L4 – Executive/vendor | Critical outage, major incident | As needed | Engage vendor TAC, escalate to steering group |

## Phase 3 – Regional Nuances to Master

### Travel Optimisation Example

| Plan | Total Drive Hours | Cost (at $75/hr) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metro engineers commuting daily | 40 hrs | $3,000 |
| Local cluster crews | ~4 hrs | $300 |

Savings fund additional QA visits or spares kits.

### Site Access Realities

- **Retail:** Schedule before 9 am or after 6 pm, budget extra time for floor walks and bag checks.
- **Distribution centres:** Observe dock safety inductions, coordinate forklift support for heavy kit.
- **Offices:** Secure weekend climate control, ensure security knows to expect technicians.

### Parts Strategy

- Establish micro-depots (Bendigo, Ballarat, Shepparton, Wodonga) with at least 10% spare inventory.
- Track part usage daily; trigger replenishment automatically.
- Label all cases with project code, site, and sequence number to avoid “mystery pallets”.

## Phase 4 – Post-Rollout & Hypercare

1. **Warranty & Asset Management** – Record serials, register warranties, update CMDB/asset register, attach install photos.
2. **Documentation Handover** – Network diagrams, config backups, updated runbooks delivered to ops team.
3. **Hypercare Window (2–4 weeks)** – Dedicated hotline, daily monitoring of incident queues, fast-track resource allocation.
4. **Lessons Learned Workshop** – Capture what worked/failed, update playbooks before the next wave.
5. **Closeout Report** – Schedule adherence, budget variance, issues log, KPI dashboard, client satisfaction scores.

### KPI Dashboard Snapshot

| KPI | Target | Actual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sites delivered on schedule | ≥95% | 96% |
| First-time success rate | ≥90% | 92% |
| Average travel cost/site | <$250 | $210 |
| Hypercare incident volume | <0.5 per site | 0.3 |
